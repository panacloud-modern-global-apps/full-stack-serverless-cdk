## AWS CDK

[AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages. With AWS CDK, you can define your infrastructure as code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. AWS CDK is available to use in all AWS regions. In this learning repo we will use CDK with TypeScript.

[What is the AWS CDK?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)

We expect that Open Source AWS CDK will become the defacto standard for Infrastructure as Code (IAC) not just for AWS but other clouds as well. Thus becoming the standard IAC multicloud tool. It is already available for [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk) and [Kubernetes](https://cdk8s.io/). CDK has already become the de facto software development framework internally at AWS. AWS CDK is DevOps for Developers and is the Ultimate DevOps tool.
