# Authentication with Amplify

The Amplify Framework uses Amazon Cognito as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery & other operations. 

Amplify makes it very easy to use your user pool that you defined in your cdk stack.


There are two ways to add authentication capabilities to your application.

- Use pre-built UI components
- Call Authentication APIs manually


We are only going to cover the pre-build UI components in this step. You can get more information [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/js)
