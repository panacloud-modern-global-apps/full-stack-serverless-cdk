     * The AWS environment (account/region) where this stack will be deployed.

     * Set the `region`/`account` fields of `env` to either a concrete value to
     * select the indicated environment (recommended for production stacks), or to
     * the values of environment variables
     * `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`/`CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` to let the target environment
     * depend on the AWS credentials/configuration that the CDK CLI is executed
     * under (recommended for development stacks).
     *
     * If the `Stack` is instantiated inside a `Stage`, any undefined
     * `region`/`account` fields from `env` will default to the same field on the
     * encompassing `Stage`, if configured there.
     *
     * If either `region` or `account` are not set nor inherited from `Stage`, the
     * Stack will be considered "*environment-agnostic*"". Environment-agnostic
     * stacks can be deployed to any environment but may not be able to take
     * advantage of all features of the CDK. For example, they will not be able to
     * use environmental context lookups such as `ec2.Vpc.fromLookup` and will not
     * automatically translate Service Principals to the right format based on the
     * environment's AWS partition, and other such enhancements.
     *
     * @default - The environment of the containing `Stage` if available,
     * otherwise create the stack will be environment-agnostic.
     * @example
     *
     * // Use a concrete account and region to deploy this stack to:
     * // `.account` and `.region` will simply return these values.
     * new MyStack(app, 'Stack1', {

     *     account: '123456789012',

     * // Use the CLI's current credentials to determine the target environment:
     * // `.account` and `.region` will reflect the account+region the CLI
     * // is configured to use (based on the user CLI credentials)
     * new MyStack(app, 'Stack2', {
     *   env: {
     *     account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT,
     *     region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION
