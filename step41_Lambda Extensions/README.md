# Lambda Extension
Lambda Extensions is designed to be the easiest way to plug in the tools you use today without complex installation or configuration management. You deploy extensions as Lambda layers

## AWS Lambda Logs API
Lambda automatically captures runtime logs and streams them to Amazon CloudWatch. This log stream contains the logs that your function code and extensions generate, and also the logs that Lambda generates as part of the function invocation.Lambda extensions can use the Lambda Runtime Logs API to subscribe to log streams directly from within the Lambda execution environment. Lambda streams the logs to the extension, and the extension can then process, filter, and send the logs to any preferred destination.



## Extensions can run in either of two modes â€“ internal and external.

* Internal extensions run as part of the runtime process, in-process with your code. They allow you to modify the startup of the runtime process using language-specific environment variables and wrapper scripts. Internal extensions enable use cases such as automatically instrumenting code.

* External extensions allow you to run separate processes from the runtime but still within the same execution environment as the Lambda function. External extensions can start before the runtime process, and can continue after the runtime shuts down. External extensions enable use cases such as fetching secrets before the invocation, or sending telemetry to a custom destination outside of the function invocation. These extensions run as companion processes to Lambda functions.



## Key Points to remember in development of Lambda Extension

* We will deploy Lambda Extension as lambda layers.
* Give Name extensions to folder of lambda layer so it will automatically pick it as extension.
* Lambda look only for one file in your extension folder so we will be using shell script file.In shell script file we will provide location about our extension
